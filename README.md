## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE
3. Run the `main` class to launch the application

## 📁 Data Management

The system utilizes two CSV files for data storage:

- `users.csv`: Stores user credentials

These files are included in the project and do not require manual creation.

2. Enter your credentials (refer to `users.csv` for existing users)

### For Administrators:
1. Choose "Admin Login" from the main menu
2. Use the default admin credentials:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: 123

**Note:** It is strongly recommended to change the admin password upon first login.
